I started this repository to keep track of experimentation with DAMA assets and generative AI.

## Table of Contents
 * Chatlogs - These are copies of discussions I've had with various GEN AI tools.  
 * Demos - These have been put together with open source to demonstrate a component of an overall solution.

### Demos

#### Demo 1 - Experiment with DMBOKV2.pdf and GenAI RAG solution
 
The first experiment will be to develop an AI RAG solution to be able to talk to the 
Data Management Book of Knowledge (DMBOK) version 2.   This asset is owned by DAMA and will need to be acquired from DAMA to run this demo on your own.
